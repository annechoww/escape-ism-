## Revisions Made
- Narrowed down Scope
  - Original Scope: 
    - Explore a new world. Certain areas of the world are currently greyed out. Collect musical notes by walk/run to restore areas. Once an area is restored, a music note is collected. Each world is representative of the piece itself. Once all the areas are coloured/all music notes are collected, a new world opens. 
For the sake of the timeline. Will limit this to 1 world for early iteration then expand if time allows. If completed, the character transports back to reality where it's a sunny day.
  - Update Scope:
    - Removed musical elements and color fading elements. Can revisit but scope should have a clearer focus on its mechanics  

- Initial introduction of the character

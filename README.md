# Bunny's Coin Quest
In this cozy, time-challenging adventure, players control a bunny who escapes a rainy day by daydreaming themselves into a new world, where they must collect scattered coins before time runs out. If all coins have been collected the portal will take the bunny to unexplored parts of the world where they can continue their exploration.

This document showcases the current state of the project, what’s been implemented so far, and how to run it.

## Core Gameplay
- **Objective:** Collect all the coins in each level before the timer runs out to “escape” the rainy reality and enter a new, vibrant realm.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** The game combines collection mechanics with light platforming. Players must navigate through the terrain to gather all the coins while being challenged by the ticking clock which closes the portal once time runs out.
- **Target Audience:** Casual players who want a cozy, stress-free escape from reality with simple and easy to learn mechanics and a warm artistic world. 

## Controls
Player movement is controlled using the arrow keys, buttons are activated with mouse clicks, and UI prompts can be navigated using the Enter key.

## Current Status
Currently, the project is in its final stage, where minor polishing is being added.

## Future Plans
Given the current status of the project, there is potential for future iterations of the project to enhance the game:
- Adding more fun gameplay interactions (speeding up, jumping, etc.)
- Adding more audio indicators (button clicking, level completion, time running out, etc.)
- Cross-fade transitions between levels
- Additional levels

## Timeline
**Milestones**
1. Prototype movement and exploration (December).
2. Add placeholder assets and basic mechanics (January).
3. Test and iterate on gameplay (February-March).

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, you will need:
- Unity version: This project was developed using Unity 6000.0.32f1. You can download it from the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
- Version Control: Git

## Setup & Running the Game
### Cloning the Repository

git clone https://github.com/annechoww/escape-ism-.git
```
### Setup Project
1. Open Unity Hub and click on **Add** to open the project directory you just cloned.

### Running the Game
Once the project is set up, click on the **Play** button at the top of the Unity editor to run the project.

## Revisions Made
- Narrowed down Scope
  - Original Scope: 
    - Explore a new world. Certain areas of the world are currently greyed out. Collect musical notes by walk/run to restore areas. Once an area is restored, a music note is collected. Each world is representative of the piece itself. Once all the areas are coloured/all music notes are collected, a new world opens. 
For the sake of the timeline. Will limit this to 1 world for early iteration then expand if time allows. If completed, the character transports back to reality where it's a sunny day.
  - Update Scope:
    - Removed musical elements and color fading elements. Can revisit but scope should have a clearer focus on its mechanics  
- Initial introduction of the character
